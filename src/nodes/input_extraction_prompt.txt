Extract structured information from the user input to download trading data.

User Input: "{user_input}"

Current Inputs (if any, YAML format):
```yaml
{current_inputs_yaml}
```

Identify and extract the following fields from the user input:
- Exchange: The cryptocurrency exchange (e.g., Binance, Kucoin, Coinbase, FTX).
- Asset Pair: The trading pair (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/BTC). If only the base asset is provided, assume the quote asset is USDT.
- Timeframe: TheCandlestick timeframe for data download (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, 1d, 1w, 1M).

Instructions:
- Consider the "Current Inputs" to refine the extraction, especially if the user is correcting previous inputs or providing incremental information.
- The response MUST be in YAML format.
- If any field cannot be extracted, return null for that field.
- Ensure that Asset Pair is always in BASE/QUOTE format. If quote is missing, default to USDT.
- Timeframe should be in a short, common format (e.g., 1d, 1w, 1M).
